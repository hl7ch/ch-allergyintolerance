In this section, the relationship between adverse reactions and manifestations of allergies or intolerances and their mapping is described. The basics for this are explained in the [Boundaries and Relationships](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/allergyintolerance.html#bnr) section of the [AllergyIntolerance](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/allergyintolerance.html) resource. The practical use and the differences between the elements `reaction` and `reaction.manifestation` are described and shown exemplarily below.

### Practical Use and Differences
1. [Multiple `reaction` entries](#multiple-reaction-entries) are useful for capturing different reactions that may have occurred during separate exposures or for documenting a detailed history of the progression of the reactions.   
2. [Multiple `reaction.manifestation` entries](#multiple-reactionmanifestation-entries) within a reaction capture the different symptoms that occurred simultaneously during the same episode of reaction.

#### Multiple `reaction` entries
[Example 1](AllergyIntolerance-CH-AllergyIntolerance-MultipleReactionEntries.html): A patient has a penicillin allergy with documented reactions at two different times.
* The first `reaction` records a moderate reaction during the patientâ€™s first exposure, with eruption of skin as a symptom.
* The second `reaction` documents a severe reaction during a later exposure, including dyspnea and lip swelling.

#### Multiple `reaction.manifestation` entries
[Example 2](AllergyIntolerance-CH-AllergyIntolerance-MultipleManifestationEntries.html): A patient reacts to shrimps with a range of symptoms that appear all at once.
* There is a single `reaction` entry representing one episode.
* Multiple `reaction.manifestation` entries within this reaction document a range of symptoms (dyspnea, lip swelling, and nausea) that occurred simultaneously during this reaction.
